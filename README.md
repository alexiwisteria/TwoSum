# Two Sum Java Project

## Overview

The **Two Sum Java Project** is a simple yet effective implementation of the classic [Two Sum problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) commonly found in coding interviews and algorithm challenges. The project includes:

- A `TwoSum` class that provides a method to find two indices in an array such that the numbers at those indices add up to a specific target.
- A comprehensive `TwoSumTest` class containing unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the `twoSum` method under various scenarios.

## Features

- **Efficient Solution:** Utilizes a HashMap to achieve a time complexity of O(n), making it highly efficient for large datasets.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes multiple test cases covering normal scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions to ensure reliability.
- **Beginner-Friendly Documentation:** Well-documented code with JavaDoc comments and inline explanations to aid understanding for new developers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **JUnit 5:** The project uses JUnit 5 for unit testing. Ensure it's included in your project's dependencies.

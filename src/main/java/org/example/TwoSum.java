/**
 * The {@code Solution} class provides a method to solve the Two Sum problem.
 * <p>
 * The Two Sum problem is defined as finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
 * This class includes a method {@code twoSum} that returns the indices of these two numbers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example:</strong>
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * int[] nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
 * int target = 9;
 * Solution solution = new Solution();
 * int[] result = solution.twoSum(nums, target);
 * // result should be [0, 1] because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses a {@link HashMap} to store numbers and their indices for quick lookup,
 * achieving an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).

     * Finds the indices of the two numbers in the {@code nums} array that add up to the {@code target}.

     * @param target The target sum for which two numbers in {@code nums} should add up.
     *               For example, {@code 9}.
     * @return An array of two integers representing the indices of the numbers that add up to {@code target}.
     *         For example, {@code [0, 1]} because {@code nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9}.
